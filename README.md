# DrillMate2
A comprehensive Marching Band drill chart creator.

Currently in Beta!

Similar to the previous iteration of DrillMate, this program allows for Marching Band drill charts to be created more quickly and easily. Groups of points can be edited on-the-fly, and simulations can be ran to view how students will march on the field.

More info will be added later!
